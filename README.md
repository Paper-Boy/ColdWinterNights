## Teaser

The wind blows around your nose. The cold burns like a thousand little needles in your face and it is difficult to keep your eyes open in this blizzard. 

Your flashlight lights your way through the woods and clearings of the icy environment where you find yourself.

As you try to orientate yourself by your quickly fading footprints, you realize that you are not alone... Suddenly an ice-cold chill passes through you and you feel your end has arrived...


Enjoy this nice, simple casual game that takes place on a cold winter night in an unknown ice desert.
